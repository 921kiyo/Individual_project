Problem setting

Two most studied approach for using previous learning exprience is meta-learning and transfer learning

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Background}

Baysian Optimisation

RNN approach


\section{Reinforcement Learning}

TODO Explain how reinforcement learning works

\section{Symbolic Learning}

TODO Explain how symbolic learning works

\section{Existing research (background research)}


TODO What would you learn in my context? Relashinship of the objects?

\section{Plan for the summer}

which measurement would you use? (grid word, something else? GVGAL games)
Summarise different types of knowledge representations (Objects ?? relationship?)

Common sense

Implement based on \"Towards Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning \"
