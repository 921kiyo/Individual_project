Problem setting

Two most studied approach for using previous learning exprience is meta-learning and transfer learning

Artificial General Intelligence

Definision of AGI



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Background}

The history of data-efficient learning
What other people have done in this.

The advance of statistical machine learning methods, especially deeep reinforcement learning

AlphaGo, and AlphaGo Zero

Also business success.

History of Relational Reinforcement Learning

Baysian Optimisation

RNN approach

Symbolic Deep reinforcement learning

Some implementation: German paper

\chapter{Motivation}

Why symbolic reinforcement learning is good attempt


Reason 1: Complehensive by humans -> Explanable rather than black-box
Reason 2: Similar to the human, it uses reasoning

Use of previous experience (background knowledge)

Not much explored yet.

However there is a room for exploration on this field.

TODO Explain how reinforcement learning works

Reason 3: Recent advance of ILASP is promissing

Because of the recent advancement of logic-based learning and deep reinforcement learning, combination of both approach would be a next explonation toward artificial general intelligence.


\section{Objectives}

combining the two novel approaches to overcome the problems of the QND

\section{Project outline}

The probject outline

Implement baseline performance (DQN)


Pipeline
Implement the CNN side that is able to extract features of the game and convert into ASP syntax.


Apply ILASP to the ASP, which involves development of the pipeline of ILASP in Python

Finally use Q-learning that allow



which measurement would you use? (grid word, something else? GVGAL games)
Summarise different types of knowledge representations (Objects ?? relationship?)

Common sense

Implement based on \"Towards Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning \"

\section{Contribution}


\chapter{Background}

ASP

What is ILP?

ILASP


ILASP task containing a contex-dependent example



TODO Explain how symbolic learning works

TODO What would you learn in my context? Relashinship of the objects?
Objects, types, locations and interactions.
